# Contributing Guidelines

## Workflow

1. **Always work on feature branches**: Each teammate should create and push changes to a new branch based on the feature or fix (e.g., `dev`, `feature-login`).

2. **Commit regularly**: Make small, frequent commits with meaningful messages.

3. **Create pull requests (PR)**: Once the feature is ready, push the branch and open a PR to merge into `main`.

4. **Review before merging**: Have a teammate review the PR before merging into `main`.

5. **Use `main` for stable code**: Avoid pushing directly to `main`â€”only merge via PR after approval.

6. **Sync regularly**: Pull changes from `main` to your feature branch to keep it up-to-date and avoid conflicts.

7. **Resolve conflicts carefully**: If conflicts arise during merging, resolve them on the feature branch before creating the PR.
